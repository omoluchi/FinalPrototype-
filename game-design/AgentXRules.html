    <p class="electrolize_font">
      Agent X in the Multisensory Universe is an interactive storytelling game
      that has players incorporate real life objects into the creation of a
      story.</p>
      <p class="staatliches_font">
       Each player will find 3 household items before the game:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <div class="electrolize_font">
        <b>OBJECT ALPHA</b>- any object that you can act out and associate with a place and amount of time used.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="electrolize_font">
        <b>OBJECT BETA</b>- an object that
        generates a sound or makes a noise when otherwise manipulated (tapped,
        crinkled, dropped, etc.), or both! Pick an object that makes a loud
        enough sound to be picked up by a mic.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="electrolize_font">
        <b>OBJECT GAMMA</b>- any object that is attached to a personal
        memory—something where you can clearly tell a story involving the object.
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
    </ul>
    <p class="electrolize_font">
      At each stage of the game, players will have to guess what your object is
      based on various hints based on their primary characteristic. These
      guesses will contribute to the final generation of Agent X’s adventure!
    </p>
    <p class="staatliches_font">
      Remember - This game is about creating a unique universe, so be as creative as possible with your objects and guesses!
